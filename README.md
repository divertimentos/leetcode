## Arrays

- **Intersection of two arrays** (easy): I have iterated through the two given lists. If the outer index is contained by the inner list **and** wasn't already added to the result unique list, then it's appended to the result list.
- **Happy Number** (easy): Use recursion to replace the original given parameter by the sum of the square of its digits.
