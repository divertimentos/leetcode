# How to learn a problem on Leetcode if you can’t solve it

This is the way I solved problems when I was preparing for Placements.

First of all, watching a video solution to a problem **will not make you learn**. Can’t solve a problem? Follow this process:

1. **Spend 20-30 mins on the problem.**

- Try to come up with the solution on your own.
- Think of different approaches, and write Pseudo Code.

Can’t think of any approach?

2. **Check the tag of the Problem**
   - Try to know which algorithm or Data Structure can solve this problem.
   - Now, try solving the problem with the help of mentioned tags.

Unable to come up with any solution?

3. **See Top submitted solutions**
   - Try to understand their approaches and learn what’s new.
   - Now, try to apply that approach and solve the problem.

Unable to do it now too? No Problem

4. **Search for a video solution on YouTube**

   - Now, watch the solution and learn it.
   - Submit the solution.
   - The process is not completed yet.

5. **Add this problem to a Folder**
   - Build a folder and add all the problems in it which are not solved by you.
   - Pick these problems again after 2-3 weeks and repeat the process.
   - So, this was the ideal process that you should be using to solve **Leetcode** Problems.
   - This will improve your Reading, Debugging, and obviously Coding.
